In Binary Tree, Inorder successor of a node is the next node in Inorder traversal of the Binary Tree. Inorder Successor is NULL for the last node in Inorder traversal. 

In Binary Search Tree, Inorder Successor of an input node can also be defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node. So, it is sometimes important to find next node in sorted order.




Solution:


 Node inOrderSuccessor(Node root, Node n)
    {
 
        // step 1 of the above algorithm
        if (n.right != null) {
            return minValue(n.right);
        }
 
        // step 2 of the above algorithm
        Node p = n.parent;
        while (p != null && n == p.right) {
            n = p;
            p = p.parent;
        }
        return p;
    }
 
    /* Given a non-empty binary search
       tree, return the minimum data 
       value found in that tree. Note that
       the entire tree does not need
       to be searched. */
    Node minValue(Node node)
    {
        Node current = node;
 
        /* loop down to find the leftmost leaf */
        while (current.left != null) {
            current = current.left;
        }
        return current;
    }
