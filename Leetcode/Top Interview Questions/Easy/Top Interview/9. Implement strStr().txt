Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().


Solution:

class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        
        int l1 = haystack.length(), l2 = needle.length();
        if (l1 < l2) {
            return -1;
        } else if (l2 == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int threshold = l1 - l2;
        for (int i = 0; i <= threshold; ++i) {
            if (haystack.substring(i,i+l2).equals(needle)) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
        
}
